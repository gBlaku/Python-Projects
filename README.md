Stock Price Predictor uses Quandl API (free version, so only up to 2018) as well as Machine learning and Linear Regression libraries to try and predict the price of a stock over the course of the next 30 days, given a date. Ex: 2018/01/01 - 2018/01/30.

COVID-19 Stats uses parsed CSV data from https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 to display a range of COVID-19 information including total cases, deaths, recovered, and more.





CREDIT to codex.me, I am simply trying to learn Python with projects provided by them.
